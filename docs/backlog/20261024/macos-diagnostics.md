# Preserve bounded native macOS launch diagnostics

Archival draft only. Do not merge this archive into personal or main.

- Patch comparison base: `9945d74354ab07942f171be329cf81c9478fc5e2`
- SHA-256: `bb1e2a7422adeabf7caa6df7fb0fcbf0091b31461cadb256a55bda0dcb1a0263`
- Intended behavior: Archival diagnostics only; compare with merged passive observer implementation, exclude redundant repeated probes before upstream submission.
- Candidate dependencies: none recorded; recheck on extraction
- Upstream prerequisites: #1042

The patch stores exact source fragments, not a ready-to-merge implementation.
Imports, combined adjacent hunks and shared test changes may require other
archive items. Hunk ownership is for preservation, not proof of independence.
The original 18-item history is recorded in the inventory.

All integrated fragments together were reconstructed in an isolated Git index
and matched the exact source tree. That integrity check does not prove any
one extracted feature works. Existing integrated CI must not be attributed to
this individual archive. No production files or services were changed.

Before proposing upstream: inspect current main, remove already-merged code
and historical experiments, extract the smallest coherent implementation,
review all hunks, run meaningful failure controls and appropriate platform CI.
Close this backup PR only after its upstream replacement is recorded and its
published head verified; keep the branch and links for traceability.
